# RubberBullets-Mod
## Description:
This mod adds the option to fire rubber bullets from guns, doing blunt damage and helping to incapacitate without killing. Use '\\' to activate/deactivate. Rubber bullets are best for short-mid range incapacitation rather than long range firefights. Rubber bullets have the same damage as standard bullets at point-blank range, but scale down to 50% damage at max range.

## Known Bugs/Limitations/Requirements:
Requires Harmony above it in the mod order.
